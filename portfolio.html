                            <li>Details: A Java-based game about the Tower of Hanoi. The game is a mathematic puzzle, containing 3 rods and disks of various sizes. The goal is to place all disks in a destination rod, but it must be for a tower. To successfully create a tower, it must follow the rule that the smaller disk is on top at each level. This creates the shape of a mountain or tower. The game has different difficulties by increasing the number of disks. Since the rods remain at a constant of 3, it becomes increasingly difficult to with more disks.</li>
